# Parallel Processing (Concurrent Programming) <a name="ParallelProcessing"></a>
  - ### BIG IDEA - It would be useful if we could do more than one thing at the same time on the same computer.

## Threads <a name="Threads"></a>
###### threads
- Threads are a way to run multiple "processes" at the same time, and are used to create "parallel" (or "concurrent") programs.
- Threads are relatively resource-heavy, as each thread requires its own "stack" and "heap" to run, and can be
  challenging to manage and debug when there are many threads running at the same time and sharing mutable state.

- ### Example of Threads in Kotlin <span style="color:red;">**_(NOTE: This code has a race condition problem...)_**</span>
  ```Kotlin
  fun main() {
     var x = 0
     val NUMBER_OF_CYCLES = 100

     val thread1 = Thread {
        for (i in 1..NUMBER_OF_CYCLES) {
           x++  // <-- `x++` is not an "atomic" operation, it performs multiple operations to read, calculate, and write `x`.
           println("Thread 1: i=$i, x=$x")
           Thread.sleep(10) // milliseconds
        }
     }
     val thread2 = Thread {
        for (i in 1..NUMBER_OF_CYCLES) {
           x++  // <-- `x++` is not an "atomic" operation, it performs multiple operations to read, calculate, and write `x`.
           println("Thread 2: i=$i, x=$x")
           Thread.sleep(10) // milliseconds
        }
     }
    
     thread1.start() // <-- `start` tells the thread to start running.
     thread2.start() // <-- `start` tells the thread to start running.
     thread1.join()  // <-- `join` tells the main thread to wait here until `thread1` is finished.
     thread2.join()  // <-- `join` tells the main thread to wait here until `thread2` is finished.
       
     println("Final value of x: $x, should be ${NUMBER_OF_CYCLES * 2}")
  }
  
  main()

  // Output:
  // Thread 2: 1, x=0
  // Thread 1: 1, x=0
  // Thread 2: 2, x=2
  // Thread 1: 2, x=2
  // Thread 2: 3, x=4
  // Thread 1: 3, x=5
  // Thread 2: 4, x=6
  // Thread 1: 4, x=7  // <-- Notice that the order of the output is not consistent, as the threads are running concurrently.
  // Thread 1: 5, x=8
  // Thread 2: 5, x=8
  // Thread 1: 6, x=10
  // Thread 2: 6, x=10 // <-- Notice the value of `x` is not consistently incrementing, as the updates are not `atomic`.

  // Thread 1: i=100, x=190
  // Final value of x: 190, should be 200  // <-- Notice final value of `x` is not epected value 200. This is a "Race" condition.

## Race Condition Problem Diagram <a name="RaceConditionDiagram"></a>
###### race-condition-diagram
- ### BIG IDEA - The problem with the above example is that the threads are updating the value of `x` at the same time, and the order of the updates is not consistent, so the final value of `x` is not the expected value of `200`.

- The problem with the above example is that the threads are updating the value of `x` at the same time, and the order
  of the updates is not consistent, so the final value of `x` is not the expected value of `200`.
- This is called a race condition, and is a common problem with threads and other parallel processing systems.
- The problem is that the threads are not "atomic", meaning that the updates to `x` are not guaranteed to be consistent
  and in the correct order, as the threads are running concurrently and updating `x` at the same time.

         Shared variable `x`->>Thread 1: Read `x` (0).
         Shared variable `x`->>Thread 2: Read `x` (0).
         Thread 1->>Shared variable `x`: Calculate new value & set `x` (1) .
         Note right of Shared variable `x`: `x` value is set to 1.
         Thread 2->>Shared variable `x`: Calculate new value & set `x` (1).
         Note right of Shared variable `x`: `x` value is set to 1 AGAIN - WRONG!
  
         Note right of Shared variable `x`: `x` value should be 2, but is 1 due to race condition.
         Note right of Thread 1: Sometimes the sequence of updates are correct...
         Shared variable `x`->>Thread 1: Read `x` (1).
         Thread 1->>Shared variable `x`: Calculate new value & set `x` (2).
         Shared variable `x`->>Thread 2: Read `x` (2).
         Thread 2->>Shared variable `x`: Calculate new value & set `x` (3).
         Note right of Shared variable `x`: `x` in this case updated correctly to 3.
         Note right of Shared variable `x`: It's random and unpredictable when
         Note right of Shared variable `x`: the updates will be correct.

## Coroutines <a name="Coroutines"></a>
###### coroutines
  - ### BIG IDEA - Is there a way to simulate parallel execution and avoid the complexity and overhead of threads?
  
  - Coroutines are another way to run multiple processes at the same time, just like threads.
  - Swapping threads in and out of the CPU is relatively resource-heavy, and can be challenging to manage and debug.
    - [<img src = "assets/thread-time-diagram.png" width="500"/>](assets/thread-time-diagram.png)
  - Coroutines always run on one or more threads, so threads are still used to run the coroutines, but abstracted away.
  - Coroutines are relatively resource-light and simplify the management of where parts of the program are running, so
    you can have many more coroutines running at the same time than you can have threads. 
  - Coroutines are built-in to the Kotlin language, and are a first-class citizen. Use of coroutines is built-into
    the standard libraries and leveraged by the language itself.

## Coroutines are Much Faster Than Threads <a name="CoroutinesVsThreads"></a>
###### coroutines-vs-threads
  - ### BIG IDEA - Coroutines are much faster than threads, as they are much lighter weight and can be run in parallel on the same thread.
  
  - Instead of swapping out the entire stack and heap of a thread each time the task is swapped, coroutines can be 
    paused and resumed at any point in the execution of the coroutine, and can be run on the same thread as other 
    coroutines.
  - This is due to change in the language and the JVM to support coroutines, and the use of "continuations" to save 
    the state of the coroutine at any point in its execution, and then resume the coroutine from that point at a later 
    time.
