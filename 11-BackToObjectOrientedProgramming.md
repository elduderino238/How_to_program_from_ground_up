# BOOP Style (Back-to Object Oriented Programming) 1980s-Present  <a name="boop"></a>
  ## Can we re-visit the original principles of OOP to make software easier to understand and maintain?
  - ### BIG IDEA #1 ‚Äî The state of the program is immutable and is only changed by creating a totally new state by modifying the old state.
  - ### BIG IDEA #2 - The state of the objects is private and only mutable via methods that are called on the object.  

## Alan Kay Style OOP (The **_Original_** Object Oriented Programming)
  - Based on the idea of "messaging" between objects, VERY poorly named "object oriented programming", admitted 
    by Alan Kay himself, the inventor of the term.

    >> ### Alan Kay:
    >> - ### _**"I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term ‚Äúobjects‚Äù for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea."**_ 
    >> - The big idea is ‚Äúmessaging.‚Äù 
    >> - The key in making great and growable systems is much more to have things communicate through _messages_ and not through direct mutable state.
    
  - ### BOOP style takes the "message" metaphor to mean that the state of the program is immutable except by sending messages to program objects in order to create a new state.
    - The `object` state can only changed by creating a new state via modifying the old state by calling `public` 
      methods on objects.
    - The state of the `object` is `private` and only accessible via methods that are called on the object.

  - All state is fully retained in the `object` and methods are used to "send messages" to the `object` to
    change its state. This "messaging" metaphor stands up because internal state is not directly accessible. You
    must politely ask the object to change its state, and the object can choose to respond to the message or not.
    Unlike in COP where internal state is routinely exposed and directly manipulated via `static` methods and variables.
  - State of the object is exposed only via "messages" (method calls to the objects `public` methods,) and the object 
    can _choose_ to respond to the message or not.
  - No `static` methods or variables, only `private` instance variables inside the `object`.
    - Use of `static` methods and variables is specifically disallowed as it leads to dreaded "shared mutable state" and
      "side effects" that are difficult to maintain and understand as program complexity grows.
      > Objects vs. Static Methods - Yegor Bugayenko
      >   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0dqC_3Bch8
  
  - `protected` methods are allowed, but discouraged as they lead to "fragile" and "rigid" code.
  - Use of inheritance is explicitly discouraged, and prefer composition over inheritance. 
    - Exceptions for shallow hierarchies of 2-3 levels maximum meant to model the real world objects, not to create a "hierarchy of types to `extend` functionality."
  - Use of `interface`-s is limited to `class`-es that require individual testing, and are not automatically added for every `class` without thinking.
  - Use of `set`-ters and `get`-ters is specifically disallowed. Instead, the object is expected to respond to messages to change its
    state, and to respond to messages to reveal (transfer) its state.
   
  - There are only a few true BOOP languages, "Smalltalk," "Ruby," and, _incredibly_, "Javascript" are among the most popular ones.

>  - Although these patterns are slowly seeping into some areas of software development, like "Compose" from JetBrains,
>    these ideas are not known or understood by most software developers, and very few libraries use BOOP patterns.
>> ### A quote from Yegor's Blog Post from a fellow developer about Yehor's BOOP patterns: 
>> ## ‚ÄúRecently I have seen the first part of your lecture called ‚ÄúPain of OOP‚Äù and was very intrigued by the average age of the visitors. How do you think, will it be hard for them to find a job when the courses are over? Won‚Äôt that leave a ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù in their minds that almost everything they will see as junior software engineers will be totally against what you taught them? Or do they have to accept that as it is, taking into account that, as juniors, they will have no right to even propose changes to the architecture?‚Äù

## Banned COP Patterns in BOOP <a name="banned-patterns-in-boop"></a>

   > - [Yegor Bugayenko, Author of Elegant Objects](https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html)

 - ### Specific COP-like "Design Patterns" are *NOT* permitted in BOOP, such as:
   - Factory Pattern.
   - Abstract Factory Pattern.
   - Adapter Pattern is OK in when used as encapsulation, as BOOP prefers composition over inheritance.
   - Facade, Bridge, Proxy and Decorator Patterns are all very similar to the Adapter Pattern and conditionally accepted in BOOP.
   - Builder Pattern considered too clumsy, the "Fluent" pattern is preferred: 
     - "Fluent Pattern" is where an `object` is modified and returned to the caller to allow for "method chaining."
     - Builder pattern is discouraged since it encourages us to create and use big, complex objects. 
     - If you need a builder, there is already something wrong in your code. 
     - Refactor it so any object is easy to create through its constructors.
     - "Default parameters" make builders obsolete in Kotlin.
   - "Marker" interfaces are discouraged. 
     - An interface with no methods, like `Serializable` or `Cloneable`, is called a "marker" interface.
     - Useful for system & library level notations, but not use in application level code.
   - Type-casting is frowned upon, and prefer the use of interfaces or composition as type-casting was only necessary 
     for COP style implementations.

     >   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrTBIcFhawI
 
 - ### Other Common COP Patterns that are Disallowed in BOOP:
   - Use of `null`-s to define the state of the object.
   - Use of `static` methods and variables.
   - `Get`-ters and `Set`-ters.
   - Reflection & Type Casting.
   - Inheritance more than 2-3 levels deep. Prefer no inheritance and use composition instead.
   - Mutable State - All state in BOOP is immutable, and the object is expected to return a new object with the new state.
   - Classes ending with -er that mutate data passed in without retaining state internal to the object.
     - Like `Manager`, `Controller`, `Handler`, `Processor`, `Updater`, `Setter`, `Getter`, `Modifier`, `Changer`, etc.
 - Amazingly, the dreaded Singleton Pattern _is allowed_ to manage global immutable state in BOOP, but no `static` variables, functions or methods.
  
## Why is Class-Oriented Programming (COP) Bad? <a name="why-is-cop-bad"></a>
  - ###### why-is-cop-bad
  - The main problem with COP is that it's common practices lead to fragile code that was difficult to maintain and
    understand, for similar reasons as to why "Spaghetti Code" is difficult to maintain and understand.
